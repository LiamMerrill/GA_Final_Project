The article's author chose to include a link directly to my recent ""Open Letter to Art Educators on Constructing an Anti-Racist Agenda"" and on why Black lives matter, written from my perspective as the elected President of the National Art Education Association. The Executive Director of the Everson, Elizabeth Dunbar, had reached out to the Director of the School of Art at Syracuse University for the names of any faculty members who might be willing to weigh in on the matter as it had become a source of controversy and a national news story. I volunteered because of my deep investment in equity work in the arts and my support for the Everson's pivot to better serve the local community by including more underrepresented artists in its collection. When I identified my willingness to go ""on the record"" in support of the Everson, the museum Director immediately reached out to convey that the Everson was at a ""pivotal moment"" where they had a number of people rotating off the board at the end of the year and were looking for the right people to join them as they try to ""walk the talk."" It was at that point that she invited me to meet her and the board Chair for the first time to engage in a conversation about serving on the Everson board in some capacity.","Given that the Everson MuseumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deaccessioning and collection expansion strategy was in sync with two of the action strategies I had sketched out in my Open Letter guiding national institutions on how to become antiracist organizations, I felt comfortable with both the initial invitation to put my name forward for consideration as well as the subsequent offer to become a trustee once the board voted me on.",Yes,,Strongly agree,Agree,,"Giving to the museum financially,Asking others to give to the museum financially,Cultivating relationships with potential trustees,Sharing expertise on strategic issues using personal and/or professional experience,Assuming fiscal responsibility for the museum,Other (please specify):",Enhancing The EversonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Brand and Public Awareness,Don't know/not sure,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,It was a pleasant surprise.
